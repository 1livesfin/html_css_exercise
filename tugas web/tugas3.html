    <b>Recently</b>, the high-end EV world has become a Nurburgring arms race with Porsche and Tesla 
    vying for the best lap at the famed circuit. The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/08/26/porsche-taycan-nurburgring-record/">Taycan set a record</a> and <b><a style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0);">Tesla</a></b> <u>CEO</u> Elon Musk 
    decided that the Model S would best it. From early reports, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/09/18/intrigue-at-the-nurburgring-as-tesla-unofficially-beats-porsche/">Fremont company did just 
    that</a> with a heavily modified vehicle.

    Ahead of the Tesla run, I sat down with Porsche's North America <u>CEO</u>, Klaus Zellmer, to talk 
    rivalries, where the <a style="color:rgb(34, 168, 0);">Taycan</a> sits in the EV world and the surprising demographics it's gathered 
    from its subscription service.

    "<i>Many people are talking about competition and all that. We love competition. We come from 
    the racetrack. The Nurburgring; we love that environment. But first and foremost, we want to 
    present an alternative, carrying the badge Porsche and the brand promise -- to everything that 
    is electric out there right now.</i>" Zellmer said.

    Apple never showed intentions of racing the <b><u>Nexus 7</u></b> to the bottom in the tablet game, and the 
    <i><b>iPhone 5c</b></i> is proof that it won't do that in the phone arena, either.

<p><b>The iPhone 5c,</b> simply put, is for those who've grown numb to Apple's largely evolutionary 
    takes on its primary iPhone range. It'll attract a younger audience that cares less about finely 
    beveled edges and more about playing <a href="”https://www.engadget.com/2013-09-10-iphone-5s-and-5c-cases.html”">Connect 4 on their iPhone case.</a> It'll cater to the same 
    <i style="color:#49d100;">crowd that has looked</i> longingly towards the $599 (again, off-contract) <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2013-08-05-motorola-moto-x-review.html">Moto X</a> -- a phone for the 
    mainstream, and a phone that's as colorful as one's soul. In a way, this is the anti-Moto X. From a 
    price, spec and feature perspective, it's a match that's too close to call. The iPhone 5c's camera 
    <a style="color:#ff0000;">has</a> an edge on the <b style="color:#ff0000;">Moto X</b>, but the X's Active Display is a boon for notifications. As these things 
    tend to go, a lot of it boils down to ecosystem preference. The iPhone 5c is being built for the 
    same audience as the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2010-09-07-ipod-nano-review-2010.html">flashy iPod nano</a>, and moreover, Apple built it for those on <u>Wall Street</u> 
    who feel that it simply <i>must</i> attract new markets to stay atop its game. </p>
    
<hr style="border : 1px solid black;">
<p>Apple never showed intentions of racing the <b><u>Nexus 7</u></b> to the bottom in the tablet game, and the 
    <i><b>iPhone 5c</b></i> is proof that it won't do that in the phone arena, either.</p>

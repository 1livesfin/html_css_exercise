    A dentist made a game in MS Paint and it's 
    terrifying

    'World of Horror' is what happens when you mix Junji Ito with HP 
    Lovecraft.

    The scariest thing about <a href="http://www.wohgame.com/">World of Horror</a> might be the fact that it's being lovingly crafted 
    by a part-time dentist. <a style="color: red;"><b>Pawel Kozminski</b></a> is the sole creator of <i>World of Horror</i>, and he 
    also practices dentistry in Poland, splitting his time between poking at people's molars 
    and placing pixels in the perfect spots using MS Paint. Yes, <i>that</i> Paint.
  </p>
  <p a style="font-size: 17px; font-family: Tahoma;">
    <i>World of Horror</i> is borne of strange circumstances, which might explain why the game 
    itself is so unsettling. It plays out in five short stories set in a seaside village in 1980s 
    Japan, whose residents are falling into mass madness while eldritch monsters rise from 
    the seas. Eerie chiptune music plays throughout the game, frantic and propelling. 
    People have gone missing, festering demons are walking the streets, and sushi chefs 
    are serving omakase with human eyeballs on the platter. Fight scenes are turn-based, 
    forcing you to stare down your fears and face slaughter one move at a time.

  <p>Apple never showed intentions of racing the <b><u>Nexus 7</u></b> to the bottom in the tablet game, and the 
    iPhone 5c is proof that it won't do that in the phone arena, either.</p>
